or “Clark’s Summer”</h2>
            <hr class="light">
            <font size: "13px">

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was sitting at my desk, surfing the web and smoking a bowl, when Clark came bounding through the door. He had a suitcase in his hand, a pillow under his arm and a guitar over his shoulder. My bags were still on my bed, unopened. It was a late August day and we had just arrived back at college to start our sophomore years. We would be sharing the ten by fifteen foot cinderblock room. &ldquo;You made it, Clark,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moondog!&rdquo; yelled Clark, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the fucking summer I&rsquo;ve had. Listen to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So remember at the end of last year, I barely got through finals, I hardly slept and couldn&rsquo;t study to save my life. Basically, I was a total mess. And I didn&rsquo;t tell you at the time, but what was going on behind the scenes, in my head, was a thousand times worse. I honestly didn&rsquo;t think I would be coming back to college. When I showed up late for my final, Professor Chuckles said to my face that I was the least prepared student he had ever had. He said it in front of the whole class. He laughed. They all laughed. But now, I&rsquo;m going to be in charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember we smoked that blunt on the roof of the Severson building before we had to move out of the dorms? Well, after that, I gathered my shit and drove back to Virginia Beach, listening to Leonard Cohen and basically thinking about killing myself the whole ride. I don&rsquo;t know why I had Cherry burn me that CD. I threw it out after the drive. When I got back home I said &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to my parents then ran off to go for a surf because I couldn&rsquo;t even face them and answer their questions about how school ended up. The surf was key, and I felt a little more chilled out that night, but was still wrestling with a million questions and couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep until like four in the morning. It didn&rsquo;t help that none of the chicks were home yet, except for the ones that never left, but I didn&rsquo;t even really want to bang anyway.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t get out of bed all day, but then my mom was knocking on my door saying cousin Zack was on the phone. Zack&rsquo;s the man, always has been, so I got up and took the phone.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Little cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I need you come on up to Block Island, I need you to learn to repair boats, and I need you to take over for me up here asap.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know where Block Island was, but my cousin was there living in someone&rsquo;s house while he fixed it up, and doing some other jobs, like repairing boats. Anyway, the light bulb above my head flicked on; some island, fixing boats, getting away from it all, just the wind and waves, it was the perfect place to get my head right. And I could always stay up there and disappear if things took a turn for the worse. Shoot myself in the head, drunk and half naked on a sailboat, like Hemingway. He explained how to get there and I said I would see him tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My parents were shocked I was going to be leaving so soon, but they understood that Zack needed me so he could captain some MILF&rsquo;s yacht down to the Caribbean, and possibly Brazil, without abandoning the house he was in charge of watching. My Dad said working on boats would make a man of me, and I told my mom I would come visit at the end of the summer and for her not to worry, the surf sucked in Virginia Beach this time of year and I was bound to get a DUI if I stayed around. So I drove up to Rhode Island, and when I was on the ferry some old salt told me that you couldn&rsquo;t get away from all the pussy on Block Island until the season ends and it&rsquo;s all gone, at which point men turn gay or worse. I told the guy to shut his faggot mouth, that if there were even one girl on this island I would be the one sleeping with her. The real Clark Holloway was back.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I drove up to the address my cousin gave me and he hugged me and said drinks were on him tonight because he was going to be leaving in a few days and I just saved his ass. We drove down to his local bar, some dive called the Crab&rsquo;s Claw, and got bombed, bombed, then brought back some girls to his cottage, which was in the yard of a fancy Victorian mansion. There wasn&rsquo;t enough room for us to both comfortably bang in the cottage, so I brought my girl outside and did her over the hull of a flipped rowboat, in the moonlight, with the sound of the ocean and the sea breeze.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two days later, I was on the dock, waving goodbye to Zack as he stood at the oversized chrome wheel of an eighty-foot yacht. He was drinking from a frothing bottle of champagne. I turned away and drove across town, back to the cottage, now rightfully mine. When I got there, I put on &lsquo;Dark Star&rsquo;, smoked a bowl, and set my mind on the endless possibilities the upcoming days would bring.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Working at the boat repair shop was a trip. Zack had helped me break the ice with the everyday crew, and I was learning fast, but they still hazed me a little bit at first. They called me things like &lsquo;landlubber&rsquo; and &lsquo;greenhorn&rsquo; and &lsquo;dickwad&rsquo;. But after work we would drink some beers and talk about girls and rock n&rsquo; roll, and one guy, the oldest and saltiest, told us the story about how in the seventies he tried PCP by accident and beat up his girlfriend at the time. The work itself was hard but fulfilling. We fixed boats with names like &ldquo;El Scorpion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tres Cabezas&rdquo;. Two weeks later, I was yoked and had hands like leather. After work I would catch some fish off the dock or shoreline then grill them outside. I had a couple weed plants going. Life felt fresh and raw, new, after the staleness of college and home.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During those first two weeks, I also got a part time job as an oyster shucker for this catering company. Obviously, I got the job by chatting up an older lady at the bar. She was the owner. So they slapped a yellow Hawaiian shirt on Clark and had me open oysters and talk to the guests. Then, my second time out, I met her. I mean, my second time working the shucking gig, I am standing there, sucking down an oyster, cold beer in my other hand, when a girl says to me, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve eaten more oysters than anyone here, even fat Uncle Angus.&rdquo; I turned to the right and there she was, a sex bomb. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her name was Rosaria. She had raven black hair, dark eyes, a slender face and a knockout body wrapped in a tight blue, white polka-dotted dress. Her arm was elegantly extended and I followed it to where a big fat bald man in a suite was eating a shrimp cocktail. I coughed on the briny saltwater from my oyster, then real quick served up one for her. I gave it an extra large dollop of salsa, to test her out, but she took it down like a champ. I finally stopped coughing and got myself together enough to say that oysters were my favorite thing in the entire world. Then I told her to follow me and we dipped away from the party. Walking along a path surrounded by blackberry bushes, we ate berries and talked about Santeria. When we got to a dead end I made out with her and probably would have done her right there if an old lady had not started yelling at us from a nearby balcony.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day we met on the beach. She was wearing a yellow bikini and had a tattoo of Jimi Hendrix soloing on her side. Her body was phenomenal. As we meandered along the shore, the ocean was so flat it seemed more like an immense lake, as if we could walk around it to the other side. She told me she had a boyfriend back home. I was not surprised at all. How many dimes are single these days? So I asked if she loved him. She said things were difficult right now, once again no surprise, but then she did say something surprising because the reason things were difficult wasn&rsquo;t because of fighting or family problems or other bullshit, not even that she didn&rsquo;t love him, but because she believed that in our entire lives, we can only really be in love with one person, and afterwards we are alone forever, as it should be. I had no idea what she was talking about, but our walk ended back at my cottage where we had the best sex of my entire life. About a million positions and she was a total freak. While we were fucking, for a moment, I felt like I was being moved by the waves, or I thought about a wave peeling down the line, to stop myself from coming, then another, waves coming one after another until infinity. I finally let go and it was like my veins had been filled with fuming mercury. But then she spoke softly in my ear and the siren song called me back. Finally, when we were exhausted and it was nighttime, we went outside to smoke a joint and drink some wine. There was a meteor shower. Then we went back in and screwed until daybreak.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About a week later, in the morning, after we were done making love, we rolled out of bed, put on some clothes, and went down to the shoreline. When we got there I put my feet in the water then walked back to where she was in the sand. She was fishing through her bag. She said, &ldquo;close your eyes,&rdquo; which I did, then she kissed me and put a piece of paper on my tongue. I swallowed it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swallow it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; I responded. <br />&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever done acid before?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I said, then opened my eyes to see her astonished face.<br /> &ldquo;You should have told me that before.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;You should have asked.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She smiled and said we were going to have fun, then ran her fingers through my hair and got on top of me.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next twelve hours were a whirlwind. I could have sworn that the sun rose and set a dozen times, and at one point there were two moons. I could hear her whispering to me, saying all kinds of things. We smoked weed and ate berries and swam and fucked and the trees and clouds were swirling. At the end of the day there was like a hot air balloon race or something, I shit you not, and this crazy vibrant sunset. The entire thing was pink and purple and orange and blue. It blew my mind. One of the balloons was a giant yellow face with a moustache. I had a million questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being with her was something else. And when I wasn&rsquo;t with her or working, I wrote music incessantly. Dude, each day was ripe with possibility. Like a tree of ripe mangos. It was fucking dripping with the shit. I played my stuff at the bar and everybody was pumped on me and Rosaria. Each day I worked my ass off on the boats, hanging with the salts or thinking about music and fucking Rosaria, she worked her job at a caf&eacute;, then after work I would swim or we would hang on the beach or bang, then she cooked up dinner and I wrote music or watched the waves, then we drank some wine and banged or just banged. She got sexier by the day, more tan, more used to eating fresh berries. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, at mid afternoon on some cool day, as we lay on an outdoor couch beneath a low tree, a cloud passed over the sun, and she asked, &ldquo;Are you going to marry me and bring me back to Virginia?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thousands of images whirled past my eyes.<br />&ldquo;No&rdquo;, I said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She looked at me, sadder than I have ever seen her. She cried, as we sat there. It almost killed me. We lay there together the rest of the day, frozen like statues.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was about a week before I left. For the next six days I stopped working and playing and Rosaria and I screwed like our lives depended on it. We screwed and took breaks only to eat and go for walks across the island. We wandered back and forth and followed every conceivable path. But we spent most of the time in bed. Sometimes, while I lay there too exhausted to think, words would float by me, and I knew one day they would go into a song.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day before I left, Rosaria and I walked down from my cottage to the seashore, where a heavy mist had settled in with the arrival of a cold front. We sat in the sand for a second and talked about being marooned on a lifeboat in impenetrable fog, as we looked out at the ocean. The water was a deep blue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go for a dip,&rdquo; I said.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll freeze.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that cold.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I walked in slowly, it was actually pretty cold, I felt pins and needles in my feet, then up my shins and knees. I walked in up to my waist and stood there looking out, everything totally obscured by fog. I looked back towards land and couldn&rsquo;t see it. Then I dunked myself and felt nothing. For a second, I lost my breath. I floated there up to my neck for a minute or two, freezing. Then I got out. I was reborn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;The next day I packed up my things and went home, chilled out for a few days, and now I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Clark, &ldquo;Are you ready for a hell of a year, Moondog?&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Hell yea&rdquo;, I replied.</p>

or “How I met Clark” </h2>
            <hr class="light">
            <font size: "13px">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was about one month into sophomore year. My bags were basically still packed from move in, and the only change Clark and I had made to our room was a Rasta colored Bob Marley poster on the wall. It was a muggy September night, a slight breeze just making it in through the window. Clark, my friend Seuss, and I were taking strikeouts in our dorm room in order to unwind; taking a bong hit of weed, then holding in the smoke while you took a shot of whiskey, then chugged a cup of beer. Seuss had just arrived an hour ago from Auburn, he had driven here to watch Cam Newton and the Tigers take on UVA. A huge waste of time if you ask me. Clark was telling a high school football story, where he went head to head with the running back from DC Williams on the goal line, blacked out, and when he came to, he was sitting on two linemen&rsquo;s&rsquo; shoulders and everyone was cheering. &ldquo;We stopped the touchdown,&rdquo; Clark said, &ldquo;we had won the game.&rdquo; Then he took a strikeout and ran out of the room coughing. My friend Seuss was laughing his ass off, and he asked me how the hell I met this shit head Clark. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It all started syllabus week, basically just an excuse to booze. I flew down from New Jersey, and spent most of my first day on campus lying in bed, overwhelmed by a never-before-felt serenity. At 9 p.m., I got up and joined some freshmen that were talking loudly about an off-campus party, the first real rager of the semester, which would be going on that night. I drank with them, a group of six other kids, then we piled into a taxi-cab and drove to a shitty old house on the outskirts of town.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Music was blaring from the house and we could hear it long before the taxi arrived at the driveway. People were mingling on the lawn, but I beelined it for the front door, and as I burst into the living room I immediately felt at home. Chaos reigned inside the house. The music was barely audible over the yells and chants that accompanied each group who were boozing together. There was a stack of kegs in one corner, and a pile of thirty-packs in the other. Two girls were kneeling at an ice luge while a third poured 101-proof bourbon down the top. I turned to watch some kid get a beer bong loaded with three beers, then raise it up and swallow it all in under a second. Then he grabbed the girl next to him and started making out with her. That was Clark.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I filled a cup of beer for myself, and then handed it off to a cute little brunette in cut off denim shorts that showed her entire ass and a tiny flannel shirt that exposed her midriff. I filled up another beer and walked to the kitchen, where I opened the fridge, saw some unopened redi-whip whipped cream, sucked the compressed gas out of it, put it back in, then walked off to the back of the house. On the back porch, two guys were lighting bottle rockets and throwing them in the air so they spun and shot in any-which-way direction. A group of ten other people were running in circles to avoid the rockets, trying not to spill their drinks. An old boxer bulldog lay in the corner of the deck, growling, clearly upset about all the noise. Some guy came out of the house and pushed me out of the way, then hunched over and puked all over the deck. What a shit-show! I walked around him, back into the house, to get another beer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back in the kitchen there was a gravity bong made from a water-cooler tank draining water into the sink and onto the floor while roasting at least an eighth of weed on the top. A live chicken ran past my legs, being chased by a short kid with a bum leg. Just when I thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any more bizarre, any more surreal, I was waiting to fill my beer, staring absentmindedly, when I saw something move quickly by the window. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A second later there was a bang on the front door, and from the other side someone shouted, &ldquo;This is the Crozet Police Department,&rdquo; and there was a loud noise but I had no idea what happened or what else was said because pandemonium had erupted and I was sprinting through the house to the kitchen. In the kitchen, I pulled a kid back by the shoulder and was the third person out the back door. I leapt off the back porch, barely registering the two police holding down kids to my right, and another officer to my left looking to cut off the escape to the street. Instinct took over and I ran strait up the gut, through the backyard, and hopped the wooden fence in one motion.<br /> I was through the neighbors yard in less than five seconds, and gazelle leaped the low mesh fence on the other side, gained speed through the next yard, climbed that fence, and was digging in, churning my legs, adrenaline pumping, flying through the third yard, when all of a sudden I was thrown back and down by my neck. I lay there, stunned.<br /> Then I heard somebody laughing. &ldquo;You just got clothes-lined by that clothesline,&rdquo; the voice said. After about five seconds the voice said, &ldquo; but seriously man, get up or else you&rsquo;re fucked.&rdquo; Then the guy helped lift me up by the shoulder and said, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We crawled around some bushes and watched five or six more kids running through the yard, then two police officers. We waited a minute, then crept along the fence and found an opening that led to a path between the fences. We followed it until we got to some patchy woods and a cemetery. &ldquo;We still aren&rsquo;t in the clear,&rdquo; the kid said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; I asked.<br /> &ldquo;Clark Holloway,&rdquo; he answered, putting out his hand.<br /> &ldquo;My name is Moondog,&rdquo; I replied, shaking hands, &ldquo;But if we get caught, I&rsquo;m Brian Dowe.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from Virginia, are you?&rdquo; Clark said.<br /> &ldquo;New Jersey.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to get caught,&rdquo; Clark continued, &ldquo;I grew up on these streets.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Sweet, you&rsquo;re from Charlottesville.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Virginia Beach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But all the streets in this state are the same. Virginia is my state.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;Fucking &lsquo;A&rsquo;,&rdquo; I said, and we walked off into the night.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two hours later we were back on campus. We had talked about high school, parties, the police, music, and getting high, and then we had walked in silence. Before parting ways to go to our dorms, I said, &ldquo;Thanks a lot man, I owe you a blunt for saving me back at that clothesline.&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three days later, I found some good weed, rolled up a blunt and tracked down Clark&rsquo;s room. When I arrived, Clark was sitting on the couch next to a kid who looked like he was about twenty-five years old, with a beard and big gut. The kid had a guitar in his hands. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who it is,&rdquo; said Clark, when I opened the door, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you were going to turn up.&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Time to get stoned,&rdquo; I said, and whipped out the blunt.<br />&ldquo;Meet Ian,&rdquo; Clark said, pointing to the kid next to him, &ldquo;our RA.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kid looked right at me. &ldquo;I would hate to write you up on the first week,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so just give me a thousand dollars and we will forget all about this.&rdquo;<br />I was debating whether to make up some story or tell the kid to fuck himself, and ended up just standing there in silence for a few seconds. Then Clark said, &ldquo;Psych! He&rsquo;s not the RA.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I looked around in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is just Roost, another student like us, and an idiot at that.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You look twenty-five.&rdquo; Then, looking at Roost, who was still holding the guitar, I asked, &ldquo;So what songs can you play?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play guitar,&rdquo; Roost said, &ldquo;But Clark does.&rdquo; Then he handed the guitar off to Clark.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clark took the guitar and strummed into one of his favorite songs, and me and those bull-shitters and some other kids from down the hall, and whoever else stopped by, smoked the blunt, and then, when we were at our most high, there was a knock on the door and Ian, the real RA, came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you smoking in here?&rdquo; Ian asked.<br />&ldquo;Sit down, Ian.&rdquo; Clark replied. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ian sat down on the couch next to Roost and I, and was about to talk, when Clark cut him off.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Ian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you had to walk in here without knocking. Last time I checked, RA&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t just walk into a room without permission. But I can look past that. You&rsquo;re not stupid, Ian, so I&rsquo;ll meet you half way. Don&rsquo;t come in my room for the rest of the semester, and we will not cause any problems for you or anyone on this hall. We just need our own space.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ian did not know what to say. The room was practically hot-boxed. We were all baked out of our minds, staring at him. Then, Clark grabbed him by the arm and stood him up, gave him a hug, and then showed him the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After that, things began to pick up speed. Things seemed to move in double-double time, like time-lapse photography. Whenever we weren&rsquo;t out partying or at classes, Clark, Roost, me, Clark&rsquo;s British roommate Ishmail, and whoever else was nearby, would hang out in Clark&rsquo;s room, smoking, playing music, reading, talking, watching TV or movies or football, drinking, having pre-games, having after-parties, banging random girls, sleeping off hangovers, smoking, and doing it all again. At some point Cherry entered the picture as Clark&rsquo;s main squeeze. She became like a sister to the rest of us, and together with her group of girlfriends we had all kinds of fun. Those days were like a whirlwind. Days of hedonism.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while what I studied and read and listened to and was interested in was not the same as it was to Clark, we did share two favorites: For both of us, our favorite band was Person Zero, and our favorite book was &ldquo;Ether Moonshine Family&rdquo; by Leon 7. That was maybe the main reason we became such good friends. Whenever we were too baked to choose a song or had exhausted all other conversation, we could always put on Person Zero or talk about some part of EMF and everybody would be laughing or feeling good instantly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that wasn&rsquo;t all we talked about. It was apparent from the beginning that Clark was a musician and songwriter. But his curiosities and short attention span meant he was constantly doing something knew, something random. He picked up painting watercolors, piano, French, tai chi and he read books by Neruda and about East-Asian Philosophy and the Pyramids, not just to yam hard body with the girls who were also interested in those disciplines, but also out of novelty. We talked about all this and all the things I was interested in and reading at the time, about Hilbert and Jon Von Neumann, about Chaos Theory, James Joyce and the political history of the Lakota tribes. It was almost like we were smoking too much weed. Or micro-dosing. Of course, we talked about Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Mojo, and the Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead, and Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain, and we listened to all their music. We listened to the Fugees when we smoked blunts and Cypress hill when we smoked bongs. Sublime and the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the hot days. Marvin Gaye on the cold. GG Allin to be punk-rock. EDM to party. And all this, the books and the music and the other diversions found their way into Clark&rsquo;s music, everybody&rsquo;s conversation, and the feel and sense of the room. In and around that room we carved out our own chunk of reality. Surreality.<br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still, those days were lived in an autumn that was mild and bright and the hills turned from green to orange and yellow, time did pass, and before we knew it, it was Halloween and we were all dressed up, sitting and standing in Clark&rsquo;s room, music playing, passing around drinks. I was a chicken, Clark was the Scarecrow, our one friend was Ace Ventura, our other was Jesus, and a friend of a friend, visiting from High School, was Hugh Heffner. Hugh Heffner&rsquo;s real name was Charles Nightingale.<br />Cherry and her girlfriends had made about twelve dozen Jell-o shots and we were working our way through them. They came in green, red, blue, clear and purple, but they were all the same flavor: grain alcohol. We were gobbling them up by the handful and feeding Nightingale a shot for each one we took. Things started to get out of hand and Clark was playing guitar with Cherry on his shoulders, and I was already making out with one of the chicks, and our buddies were scraping up the last of the Jell-o, when we decided to hit the streets. Charlottesville had transformed into a carnival street party, with Broadway being shut down to traffic and people dressed up as all kinds of things mixing and mingling between bars. There were tents and other circus shit too. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was totally fucked up from the minute we left the dorms on, so it was all pretty strange to me. But I remember walking down some poorly lit streets then emerging in the crowd of people, and one person gave me a beer because they saw I was a chicken, and Clark and Cherry were leading us, but my buddies who were Ace Ventura and Jesus decided to buy some vodka mixed with energy drink, so I got some too, and there was a baby dressed as Mr. Peanut, and a guy dressed as a baby, and I felt like throwing up for a second, but Clark passed me a joint and I chilled out.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the night went on, my friends dressed as Ave Ventura and Jesus disappeared into the vaudeville crowd, I ended up losing the group, and the last thing I saw of Clark was him at a colorful bar, taking a shot of bourbon with Nightingale, Cherry on his arm. Eventually, Nightingale disappeared also and Clark and Cherry were left alone in their own world, laughing, making fun of people&rsquo;s costumes, making out, and just barely keeping it together enough to find their way from bar to bar. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They seemed happy together, Clark and Cherry, but they had not known each other long. They had slept together loads of times, of course. But how well could you know someone who grew up in a totally different part of the country, who you had met only two months ago? Plus, they had shared their first kiss immediately after Clark had taken a beer bong. These thoughts certainly passed through Clark&rsquo;s head, and maybe even Cherry&rsquo;s, but the revelry seemed to indicate more revelry, with no end to the revelry in sight. Of course, Clark considered all strangers his friends until proven otherwise, and Cherry had a taste for new people, new places, she had grown up near D.C. and loved newness in everything. But still, Clark could not help feeling slightly off, guarded just a little, even now, at the height of the grand Halloween ball, and just then, when the clock struck midnight and Clark kissed Cherry, then pushed her out the side exit of the bar and pulled her into an alleyway, when the tension was fully mounted, at their finest moment together, Cherry said, &ldquo;Oh my god, is that someone on the ground over there?!&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clark looked over her shoulder and saw a big mass lying crumpled on the pavement. He approached it, and the worst was evident: it was Nightingale lying facedown in a pool of his own blood. Clark got down on a knee and checked his pulse, then turned Nightingale over. The blood was coming from Nightingale&rsquo;s mouth and nose, which had been smashed on the pavement.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Call him a cab, and lets get out of here,&rdquo; said Cherry, pulling on Clark&rsquo;s sleeve. Clark made no indication of having heard Cherry, so she continued, &ldquo;Please, Clark, call him a cab to the hospital and he will be ok, we should get out of here or else we might get in trouble.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Clark said, &ldquo;I am going to make this right.&rdquo; He hoisted Nightingale up onto his shoulder and started walked towards the bustling street.<br />&ldquo;Where are you going, Clark?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I am going to make sure he gets to the hospital and is taken care of.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;If you go to the hospital they will throw you in jail, don&rsquo;t be stupid. Don&rsquo;t try to be a hero.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Get lost,&rdquo; Clark replied. Then he turned around and tapped on a cab window, and he and Nightingale piled into the back seat, and the cab sped off into the night.<br />At the hospital, Clark realized how drunk he still was despite the shot of adrenaline he got when he saw Nightingale in the alleyway. He stood there like an idiot as the nurses loaded Nightingale onto a gurney and rolled him through the double doors and out of sight. Clark felt warm and relieved for a second, knowing his new friend would be ok, then he decided to get the fuck out of there and turned and ran strait into a uniformed police officer. The officer put Clark in cuffs and made him sit in the waiting room for a half hour, then loaded him into the police car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about I just go home and sleep it off,&rdquo; Clark said, as the officer turned on the radio.<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sleeping in the station tonight, drunk-ass,&rdquo; said the cop, and he turned up the volume on the radio, which was playing &lsquo;Jeremy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, Roost and I pulled up to the station in Roost&rsquo;s Escalade. Clark sauntered out, yelling something back to the officers before the door closed. He cracked a big smile when he saw us, and hopped in the backseat, and we each lit up a cigarette as Roost turned onto the road.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel half bad for sleeping on a concrete floor surrounded by drunk hobos,&rdquo; said Clark , &ldquo;they were kicking us awake every two hours too, fucking pigs. How do I look?&rdquo; Clark grinned, his hair disheveled, shirt unbuttoned, huge mustard stain on his paints.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;A hell of a lot better than Nightingale,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we just saw him in the hospital and he said he would never drink again.&rdquo;<br />We all laughed and sped off towards our local diner for some breakfast.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how I met Clark,&rdquo; I said<br />&ldquo;So he got blue-balled and busted for helping the kid?&rdquo; asked my friend Seuss, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would have done the same.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We were all there, sitting around the table in some dorm-room suite, drinking beers frantically or mixing vodka with grape juice, talking, laughing. We were getting ready to go tailgate a football game. There was some Katy Perry music on. Clark wasn&rsquo;t there, but a girl that he used to sleep with in the first part of freshman year, a good friend, made a joke about the time Clark puked on the UVA Wagon, the bus that transports people around campus. We all laughed and someone encouraged her to tell the full story and the rest of us roared in agreement. Anyway, Cherry, Clark&rsquo;s old girl, said, &ldquo;The first time it happened was around this time last year, when his friend Jimmy was in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I remember I came into his room and Moondog and Victor Fox were there also, they had an almost empty handle of vodka and Clark was drinking from a magnum bottle of orange soda. They were hammered. They were watching a YouTube video of Jimmy laying out a kick returner, chugging the vodka, shouting, so I left and came back thirty minutes later and the vodka was gone and they had a bottle of whiskey out instead. Clark was playing guitar shirtless, so I threw him one and said lets go to the party now, so we went. I don&rsquo;t remember much of the party, but I remember only seeing a few glimpses of Clark and the other guys, and none of them were at the after party.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day, when I showed up, they were in Clark&rsquo;s room, sitting around chugging beers. We were planning on tailgating UVA&rsquo;s football game; not going to the game, just drinking beforehand at the fraternity houses. They were going over the night before. Jimmy was telling Moondog and Vic Fox about how Clark had shot-gunned a few beers at the Sig Chi house then disappeared. Clark&rsquo;s friend Jimmy had made out with and fingered a girl on the dance floor. Moondog and Vic Fox said that they also made out with and fingered girls on the dance floor. Then Jimmy said that when he had to leave he couldn&rsquo;t find Clark, then somebody said he&rsquo;s passed out in the bathroom. Jimmy found him sitting on the toilet with his pants down, sleeping like a baby. He woke him up and they left the party immediately and got on the first wagon that passed by. They sat in the back. On the wagon, Clark said he didn&rsquo;t feel so good. He stood up as if to move to get out of the bus, then grabbed a seat on each side of the aisle and threw up a torrent of orange all down the middle of the bus. People screamed. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jimmy, Vic Fox and Moondog all cracked up. Clark had said &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; to the driver as he got off at his stop, but the driver just shook his head. <br />They all drank a beer and I got a beer. Jimmy and Clark told stories about growing up in Virginia Beach, football, lacrosse, surfing in the winter. They made V.B. sound a lot better than it really is. Fox told a story about the swell of the decade in Tampa Bay and they all made farting noises and threw beer on him. Finally, we got up and hopped on a wagon to go to the tailgates. After seriously thirty seconds, Clark said &ldquo;oh no&rdquo;, leaned over me, and threw up all over the aisle. I screamed and pushed him away. Other people on the aisle screamed also. Clark yelled an apology to the bus driver. When we got to the tailgate, Clark swished beer in his mouth, spit it out, then tried kiss me! Anyway, he made out with some other girl, and then sure enough, on the way home he puked on the girl&rsquo;s dress.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little did we know, but Clark&rsquo;s motion sickness was here to stay. Christmas break came and went, we got new classes in the spring and new parties to go to, but Clark&rsquo;s motion sickness persisted. And although he didn&rsquo;t throw up every time he went on a wagon, or even every time he drank and went on a wagon, he did puke enough times to get a reputation among the wagon divers, and some would laugh with him, some would ask him to sit near the door or the trash, and the graver ones would not even allow him on the wagon, so he would have to wait for the next one or walk.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning of second semester Clark&rsquo;s advisor, some lady he had talked to once, said he had to take at least two General Education classes and one had to be a writing class. Roost and Moondog had similar requirements to fill, so the three of them signed up for Intro to Poetry, the easiest writing class, and Macroeconomics, which was taught by the supposed best teacher at UVA, Dr. Alvaro Chuckles. I didn&rsquo;t sign up for either. Roost and Clark ended up in the same classes for both, but Moondog got screwed with an eight a.m. poetry class.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, on the first day of classes second semester, I came to Clark&rsquo;s room and smoked a little with him and Roost and then Moondog showed up and said eight a.m. poetry was not bad, there was this smoking hot girl with a French last name in his class, along with four other girls who were decent looking, and the class had read Dylan Thomas then called it a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your teacher?&rdquo; Clark asked.<br />&ldquo;Some fat asshole who wore sun glasses the whole time,&rdquo; Moondog replied.<br />&ldquo;Same,&rdquo; said Clark, &ldquo;Kosner.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clark told us that Kosner, who was wearing a purple sweater that barely covered his gut while standing, had sat Indian style on top of his desk, showing nearly half his ass-crack to anyone on the sides of the room. He was sweating and had, in his deep Mississippi accent, cursed non-stop for a minute while explaining &ldquo;The Road Not Taken&rdquo;. Clark also mentioned a girl named Restin Lewis in his class, who was an east coast surfer like them, but she was from Jacksonville, which had possibly the worst waves on the east coast.<br />&ldquo;Its no Bay Head,&rdquo; said Moondog. <br />&ldquo;She said she used to do some competitions,&rdquo; continued Clark, &ldquo;but she was never sponsored, like me. Regardless, she&rsquo;s a babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then they talked about Macroeconomics and Roost said that Professor Chuckles was a genius, an absolute genius, and Clark said that all the talk about supply and demand made him feel like he was going to be learning magic powers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Chuckles himself is a little squirt of a guy though isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Clark, &ldquo;I bet Kosner would fuck him up in a fight.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust Kosner&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Moondog, &ldquo;if the going got tough, he would give up like a little bitch.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two weeks later, Clark had thrown his Economics textbook out the window and was reading Poe night and day. It was hard to keep track of him, he started studying in the library more and sleeping until noon, and when he went to parties he would only show up really late. Once, he invited Restin over to smoke and beforehand asked us not to say anything about how bizarre he had been acting or about puking on the wagons. Then she showed up, and she was cute, it was my first time meeting her: long brown hair with natural highlights, tan, pretty tiny but toned. Great ass. So we smoked and talked about sororities and parties, then Clark brought up poetry and Roost did his impression of Kosner leaning back with his feet up the on desk, stomach hanging out from under his cardigan sweater. We all laughed, and then they started talking about politics! Gag me with a spoon. But Roost and Restin got a little heated, and Clark and Moondog sided with her and then Roost got up and left. Then Restin said bye in her adorable way and I didn&rsquo;t see her again until Pontooning.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After that, Clark basically stopped smiling and I seriously didn&rsquo;t see him for like two weeks. When I finally did, he was restlessly picking at his guitar. I knew he was just working on a song, but I know Clark, and I could tell that something else was going on, beside the fact that he couldn&rsquo;t ride on vans, or concentrate on school, or be anywhere on time, or that he didn&rsquo;t care about me or anyone else anymore. We were alone in his room and it was cold and gray outside the window. I looked at him, I was probably crying a little bit, and asked, &ldquo;What happened to you Clark?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stopped playing and looked up at me. He looked calm, almost normal, but he took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then said, &ldquo;Cherry, don&rsquo;t tell anyone this, but I think I might be losing it.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At that moment there was a strong draft through the window and three seconds later Clark&rsquo;s door slammed closed. Clark&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on his poster of Jimi Hendrix on the wall, which had almost been blown off by the gust of wind.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is happening to me,&rdquo; Clark said, still looking at the poster, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not in control anymore. My stomach. My heart. When I walk down the hallway I feel like I am walking a balance beam. My stomach is in my mouth and my heart is shaking. Even sitting here now, it is like I am in this chair sitting next to the precipice. I look around and it is all air and rocks far below, and I am on a little outcropping on the side of a cliff. The world is miniature and immense below me. Soon, the cliff will collapse. Or worse, I could gather up the courage or cowardice to throw myself off. I just keep telling myself to back away, for the precipice to go away.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he looked at me and asked for me to please let him explain. I, of course, said there was nothing I would rather do than listen to him talk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He continued, &ldquo;My mind has always been a little all over the place. You know I get angry, but I love to laugh; I am quick to fight, quick to forgive. Things seemed like that at first, until this precipice started setting in. Now I am just waiting for it to appear, all the time. When I feel O.K. I can think or do some work or relax, a little bit. But I am waiting for it to show up. And in class? Forget about it. Chuckles class is torture, everything he says and everybody in there makes me feel like I am already in free fall, like I can&rsquo;t catch my breath because the wind in my face is so strong. So I don&rsquo;t go. And I only go to Kosner because I have to, and the things he says and Restin says and the dead poets seem to help, but overall it is uncomfortable. And my family. At the beginning of the semester, Christmas break, seeing my family and friends only made things worse. The first time I felt the precipice was after drinking a cup of coffee with my friends at the diner. I had to get up and leave. So here I am. Me by myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I think it&rsquo;s just college, not being away from home or the stress of schoolwork, but I feel like people are making decisions for me, not the universe, not myself, but other people. They tell me what to study and that this is how I make my life. And at the same time I have all the choice in the world in terms of meeting new people, meeting new girls, living my day-to-day life. If I want to go to the park or play basketball or fuck this girl I just met, everybody is fine with it. But if I want to study anthropology instead of economics everybody calls me a pussy or a waster. So I toe the line while the world spins around me. I feel like I am on a conveyor belt being drawn toward some human determined end piece while the world around me dances and changes glitteringly fast. I need a point on the horizon or near me to fix my gaze. I need to stand still for a second, to breath deep and listen to the sound of water on rocks. How can school help me with this? The only air and water is pumped in through lead pipes. And the things that used to come naturally to me, meeting good people, making enduring friendships, playing music, playing sports, being curious, taking chances, these things have all been shoved out of sight or tucked into the corners. I love you Cherry, but we were bad together, we did not make each other better. We met at some horrible party and the love between us was shared with booze and loud music. And drinking is barely fun anymore. We&rsquo;ll always be friends though, and the close friends I have made here are the only ones I can see these days. The parties and tons of strangers and fake friends, when I am with them its is like another person joins the crowd, some demon who makes me feel like I am nothing and I have no face and words become unintelligible. Or even worse, when I am with them, a crowd, a few people, it does not matter, I feel like I am an explorer on an unknown island. I step off my canoe and onto the sand. A silent ring of savages surrounds me. They have dark brown skin and are covered in red paint. I am a savage too. I have dark brown skin covered in blue paint. They are pointing spears at me, and bows and arrows. There are women and children in the crowd also. They start to talk. They speak a language I do not understand. I speak some words and they yell to drown me out. I do some gestures with my hands and my body, to show them I do not wish them any harm, that I am just passing through. They look at me with alien eyes. I could not possibly imagine what they are thinking. For all I know, they are cannibals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point he stopped and looked at me in silence. Obviously, I had started to cry when he said we were bad together.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went on, &ldquo;You know love has something to do with it, or the absence of love. Love in everything, in the doing and the sacrifice and the little things that fill the time in between them. But this is where I feel completely stuck. I can&rsquo;t see the beauty in a poem or an equation or in another person when all signs seem to indicate that I am a unit to be processed by the school and spat out, ready to be gobbled up by the world or to eek out a way of owning my life through loans and mortgages. There is still some love for me in music though. And you know I like Restin, but I can&rsquo;t even get to know her outside of class because I am such a shell. I see endless opportunities to live, but the inertia here is crushing me. I might have to leave school and get a job. But if I get a job I might have to go on strike. And then go on strike from the strike.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;And I used to be such an agreeable guy,&rdquo; he said to me with a smile. He looked out the window, and then, softly spoke, &ldquo;I need some way to the surface. I need the universe to save me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the semester went on nothing seemed to change for Clark. We saw him more, but that was just because he stopped going to the library and spent more time in his room and in bed, and he still went to parties but it never looked like he was having fun, except for a brief period when he was very drunk but not yet totally incoherent. By the end of the semester, I honestly avoided going to his room because I still had feelings for him and it hurt to see him like that, and to not be with him or be able to help him. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the last week of the semester, in early May, I popped in to see what was going on, and found Clark, Roost and Moondog talking about a confrontation Clark had just had with Professor Chuckles during office hours. Clark had shown up to ask about opportunities to salvage his grade and possibly pass the class. Chuckles asked him why he struggled with the material while many of his peers seemed to enjoy the class and were doing well. At that point, Clark basically admitted that he thought the class was bullshit and that economics classes were herding his peers like cattle to jobs in banking and consulting and marketing, where they would be abused like cattle, while only a few truly understood and respected the discipline. Chuckles cut him off and said there were no opportunities for extra credit and for Clark to leave his office immediately, then Clark said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be short with me&rdquo;, and continued his tirade against teaching people the marginal return of eating a orange. Finally, Chuckles told Clark to study up good for the final, if he got above a B he could pass the class, and that in the future, he should stay away from any courses that could lead to an important or significant job.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We all laughed. Clark said it felt great to throw some tack back at Chuckles after listening to the man preach and be praised by dweebs for fourteen weeks. Then Roost told everyone that, by surprise, he would be passing Poetry class, even thought Kosner had written very offensive remarks on all his papers and homeworks. For the final essay, Roost wrote a twelve-page paper on Paradise Lost and got a D-. Then Clark said that he had written a twenty-five-page, stream of consciousness explorative memoir of his thoughts and feelings for the last month, and got a B. Finally, Moondog said he wrote a six page paper on &ldquo;In the desert&rdquo; by Stephan Crane and had gotten an A+.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; said Roost.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Restin got an A+ on her paper too,&rdquo; said Clark, &ldquo;Then she got up and read this dope poem. The first few lines went:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The flesh is sad&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve read every book.</em><br /><em>O to escape&mdash;to get away. Birds look</em><br /><em>as though they&rsquo;re drunk for unknown spray and skies.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then some other stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Read all the books?&rdquo; said Roost, &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; continued Clark, &ldquo;after class I ran down Kosner as he speed-walked to his car. I asked him if there was any point to majoring in Literature and he said yes, of course, you learn critical reading and writing skills that can help you in many careers. Then I asked him what he had done with his degree and he said he had been a litigator for twenty-five years. I shook his hand, hopped on a UVA wagon headed back to the dorms, and threw up all over the back seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward, we had finals week, and a few hours before I drove back to D.C. I stopped into Clark&rsquo;s room for the last time and found him sitting on his bed while Vic Fox and Moondog broke up weed for a blunt.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry to hear about what happened at your final,&rdquo; I said to Clark. Everyone had heard about Clark showing up late for the Econ final and Chuckles announcing to the class that Clark was the worst student ever.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks, Cherry,&rdquo; said Clark, looking at me with a smile, &ldquo;I actually saw him later that day, totally, by accident, I was walking to get some tacos and he was hailing a cab, and when the cab driver got there I heard Chuckles just explode on the guy, something about being late and how important Chuckles flight to Connecticut was. Chuckles was so livid that he didn&rsquo;t notice me walking up to him and the cabbie, and I got in between them, stared Chuckles dead in the eye, and said, &lsquo;Who are you? Who are you to curse this guy off and compose yourself with no decency or respect? Who the fuck are you?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;What did Chuckles say?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;He called me a little shit, sneered, and got in the cab.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said Clark, &ldquo;So want to come smoke this blunt with us? Last one of the year.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No thanks, I have to get going.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave him a hug, and as I walked away he said, &ldquo;Hey Cherry, thanks for burning me that Leonard Cohen CD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, its my favorite&rdquo;.<br />&ldquo;See you next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50%;">*</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that story didn&rsquo;t bum anybody out,&rdquo; said Cherry, looking around room. Everybody gave a sign that it was ok or just looked down at his or her cup. &ldquo;But hey,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at least that&rsquo;s all over and Clark is totally rad again.&rdquo;</p>
